            <h2>History of Automotive Engineering</h2>
            <p>The history of automotive engineering dates back to the late 19th century. In 1886, Karl Benz invented the first practical automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. This groundbreaking invention marked the birth of the modern automotive industry. Over the years, automotive engineering has evolved through numerous technological advances, such as the introduction of assembly line production by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, which revolutionized car manufacturing and made vehicles more affordable to the masses.</p>
            <p>As the industry grew, innovations such as safety features, fuel efficiency, and environmental consciousness shaped the development of automobiles. The 21st century has brought new challenges and opportunities, with electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles emerging as key focal points of automotive engineering.</p>
